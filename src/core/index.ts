/**
 * Core Groovy Engine
 * 
 * This module contains all the core logic for drum playback, timing, and audio synthesis.
 * It is completely UI-agnostic and can be used with any framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
 * or even vanilla JavaScript.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - No UI dependencies (no React, no DOM manipulation)
 * - Event-based communication (observer pattern)
 * - Pure TypeScript/JavaScript
 * - Framework-agnostic
